# tmux prefix

The Command Prefix

Since our command-line programs run inside tmux, we need a way to tell tmux that the command weâ€™re typing is for tmux and not for the underlying application.

This keypress combination is called the command prefix.

the default command prefix for tmux is Ctrl+b

Note: The default prefix to all Screen commands is Ctrl+a.
