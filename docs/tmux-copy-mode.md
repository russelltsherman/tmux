# Tmux Copy Mode

Pressing PREFIX [ places us in Copy mode. 

We can then use our movement keys to move our cursor around the screen. 

By default, the arrow keys work. we set our configuration file to use Vim keys for moving between windows and resizing panes so we wouldn’t have to take our hands off the home row. 

Tmux has a vi mode for working with the buffer as well. 
To enable it, add this line to .tmux.conf:

    setw -g mode-keys vi

With this option set, we can use h, j, k, and l to move around our buffer.

To get out of Copy mode, we just press the ENTER key. 
Moving around one character at a time isn’t very efficient. 
Since we enabled vi mode, we can also use some other visible shortcuts to move around the buffer.

For example, we can use "w" to jump to the next word and "b" to jump back one word and we can use "f", followed by any character, to jump to that character on the same line, and "F" to jump backwards on the line.
